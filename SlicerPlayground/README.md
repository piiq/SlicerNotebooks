# Slicer Playground

A set of jupyter notebooks for playing around with the Slicer python API.

The notebooks illustrate usage of various tools bundled with slicer to achieve image processing tasks. The tools and API vary in each notebook. If external data is used in a notebook (like a picture or a NRRD image), the files are bundled with the playground in the `img/` folder.
